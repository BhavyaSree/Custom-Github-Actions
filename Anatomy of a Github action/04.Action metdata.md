todo : The Actions Metadata
---

The metadata is provided in a specific yaml file called action.yml.  

When we are building a custom action, we need to give it a name and a description.  

If action accepts any input parameters, we can list them in the input section.

We can use upper case letters for parameter name but github actions convert them to lower case letters at run time. Parameter names must start with a letter or an underscore and contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore, no space is allowed.  

Actions can also return one or more output parameters just like input parameters. This is optional.
If we can any output parameters, list those under the output section.  
Output parameters cannot have default values.  

```yaml
name: 'Awesome Action'
description: 'An action that does awesome things.'  
author: Bhavya Sree
inputs:
  parameter-name:
    description: 'An input parameter.'
    required: true # If the user must specify the argument other wise all input parameters are considered optional.
    default: 'The default argument' # we can also provide default value for the default parameter.  
outputs:
  output-value-name:
    description: 'A value returned by the action.'
runs: # Tell Github how to run the action
  using: 'node12' # for javascript action. (12 is the version of the node to use).
  main: 'lib/main.js' # path to modules entry point, this file must be part of the same repository as action itself.
  # For docker actions
  # using: 'docker'
  # image: 'Dockerfile'
  # If we want the github actions to build the container image, then give the path to the dockerfile for image. If we want the image to be pulled from the public registry, we need to specify the image in the form docker://image:tag 
branding: # This is specified only if we intend to publish the action on the GitHub marketplace.
  icon: 'power' # should be one of the icons offered by feathericons.com
  color: ''yellow' # either white, yellow, blue, green, orange, red, purple or dark gray.
```
