todo: What happens at Runtime
---

Action starts to run with an event. This can be commit being pushed or pull request being opened or any other kind of event that gets triggered in a GitHub repository.  

Github actions seize these events and schedules a workflow to run on a host.  
Host downloads any actions that are referenced by the workflow. (that can be either from Github Repository(js) or Docker Registry).  

Next step is to create a temporary directory where the workflow will store any data generated at run time. This directory is called workspace and this will live as long as workflow runs.  
Being a temporary directory, the path will be different everytime. Inorder to reference it, we can use evnironment variable $GITHUB_WORKSPACE.   
Actions can upload the data or download the data from the workspace directory using upload-artifact and download-artifact.   
Workspace will be deleted at the end of workflow run.  

If we want to know what type of event triggered, we can read that using event.json file which was created at the beginning of the workflow. event.json file is also temporary, and to access this file path, we use an environment variable called $GITHUB_EVENT_PATH. In this find, we can find everything we need to know about the event like to know the list of commits that were pushed, details about the repository hosting the workflow and much more. 

```json
{
  "commits": [...],
  "repository": {...},
  "sender": {...}
}
```
