Under steps, everytime we do something like compiling or deploying, we use either run or uses.

# Shell Commands Vs Actions

## run

run is an interface to a command prompt.   
We can use run to invoke any CLI programs or combination of programs as long as they are available on the host amchine running the workflow.   

## uses

Uses invokes an action.   
We won't care what the action does behind the scenes.    
Action may rely on some other command line tool to actually do the job.  
Example: Checkout action invokes git fetch and git checkout to download the source code from the git repository.   

Therefore, Actions acts like adapters between the workflow and the command line tools.   

When does it make sense to implement some portion of the our workflow as a github action Vs invoking the command line tools directly from teh workflow itself.

### Control flow

```yaml
- name: Build
  run: | 
    npm ci
    npm run build
```

but we need to run it as of npm ci is sucess, then run nom run build

```yaml 
- name: Build
  run: npm ci && npm run build # in bash
  with:
    working-directories:
      - src/project
```
If we want to use this build logic for multiple directories, then instead of using same code multiple times, we can package the build logic inside an action that accepts one or more working directories as input.

```yaml
- name: Build
  run: actions/npm-build@v1
  with:
    working-directories:
      - src/project
      - src/another
      - src/yet-another
```

This we wouldn;t have to worry about implementing the loops inside the shell script.

If the shell does not have && or equivalent one for example powershell, we can use them separetly.  

```yaml
jobs:
  install:
    steps:
      - name: Clean install
        run: npm ci
  
  build:
    needs: install
    steps:
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
```

In the above case, build will run only after success of install.  

What if the install gets failed like we may want to log the error, there comes the diagnostic.  

### Diagnostic

Right now, there is no way to build the error handling into the work flow itself. We need to take care that inside of an action.  

```yaml
jobs:
  install:
    steps:
      - name: Clean install
        run: npm ci
  
  build:
    needs: install
    steps:
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

  error:
    steps:
      - name: Handle erro
        run: ----
```

Everything we have seen so far brings us to the larger point complexity.  

### Complexity

Workflows being declarative in nature are designed to describe the process at a high level of obstruction, namely as a sequence of steps that runs in response to certain events.

Checkout --> Build --> Deploy

```yaml
jobs:
  install:
    steps:
      - name: Clean install
        run: npm ci
  
  build:
    needs: install
    steps:
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
  
  deploy:
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy
        run: npm publish
```


They need gritty details on what should happen in any one of those steps belong outside of the workflow, where there are better tools to handle complexity.  

If we need to do the same actions on multiple directories, there comes the reuse.

### Reuse

Reuse by grouping multiple related steps into a single action.  

We can reuse it not only inside the single workflow but also across different workflows.  
If the action does something that could be useful to many people, we can even make it available to everyone by publishing it on GitHub marketplace.

```yaml
jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    steps:
      - name: Build & Deploy
        uses: ./npm_deploy@v1

  build_and_deploy_another:
    steps:
      - name: Build & Deploy
        uses: ./npm_deploy@v1

  add_another:
    steps:
      - name: Build & Deploy
        uses: ./npm_deploy@v1
```

## When should we build a Custom Action?

* When we need more control flow structures than simple `if` conditions.
* When we need to handle errors to make them easier to diagnose.
* When our workflow grows in complexity or when the command line tools we want to invoke are themselves verbose and known intuitive.
* When we need to reuse some portion of the workflow for itself or across different workflows.
