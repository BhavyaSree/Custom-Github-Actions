todo: Communicating with the host
---

Action run in their own process, isolated from each other. Yet, they need to communicate both with each other and with the user.  
They communicate through the Host.

Everytime a workflow runs, it produces a build log.   
This log contains the real time information about whats going on as the workflow.    

The log line starting with `::` and followed by some command is called logging command.  

Logging commands are the instructions to the workflow host to execute, but they come embedded in the build log. Therefore, these commands are called as logging commands.  

This allows the build process in the workflow i.e., Github actions parlance to issue commands to the build agent i.e., the Host, without invoking any special APIs or libraries.  

The build logs serves as the communication channel between the two and syntax to express the logging commands is the protocol.  

**The Logging Command Format**  

`::log-command param1=arg,param2=arg::command value`

Example: set enviorment variable to a certain value.    
`::set-env name=DEBUG::1`
Here we are setting value for environment variable DEBUG as 1.  

**Setting an Output parameter** (can be sent through build log)  

`::set-output name=name_of_param:: value`  

**Adding a Directory to the PATH variable of the host** 

`::add-path::/path/to/directory` 

**Printing a Log message** 

`::debug::message`  
accepts there optional parameters that allow us to tell exactly which part of the file we want to bring attention to
`::debug file=name,line=0,col=0::message`  

This will be same for warnings and errors.  
`::warning file=name,line=0,col=0::message`   
`::error file=name,line=0,col=0::message`  

**Print a masked message**  

If we want to print a secret value in the log, add mask.
`::add-mask::message`  
`::add-mask::******` masking the message with asterisks.  

We can also specify a variable that contains the value to mask.  
`::add-mask::$VARIABLE`

**Stopping and Starting the Log commands**  

We can tell the host to stop interpreting the log entries as commands by printing a special command called stop commands.  
`::stop-commands::token`  
Anything that comes after stop commands will be ignored.  

When we evoke stop commands, we need to provide a string, a token that we can use it later to start interpreting the log commads again.   

Resuming is done by  
`::token::`
