todo: JavaScript and Docker Actions
---

Now we can build two types of actions.
1. JavaScript Actions
2. Docker Actions

## JavaScript Actions

### Pros

* Fast   
  There are node modules that run directly on the host machine.  

* Github offers some solid development support for JS actions.    
  There is an open source toolkit with API that allow us to interact with the workflow as well as with the GitHub web API.   
  Easy to integrate with the GitHub Environment.

### Cons

* Require Setup  
  Any external dependencies must be installed before running actions or as a part of running actions.  


## Docker Actions

With Docker, we can package everything in a single container and have our workflow around it as a unit.

### Pros

* Flexible  
  They run virtually any software.

* Consistent
  Both the actions and their dependencies are bundled together.  
  They come with their own environment.  
  No need to install anything in the host.  

### Cons

* Slower  
  Because the workflow has to download the container image from the registry and start the container.  
  It takes time to download and start a container.  

* Linux Only
  They can run only on Linux hosts.
