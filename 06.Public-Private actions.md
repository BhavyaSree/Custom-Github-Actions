todo: Public vs. Private Actions
---

When we refer an action from a workflow with a `uses` keyword, what we are referring to is a group of files, at the very least we have actions metadata yaml file action.yml and inturn references a java script file, if it is a javascript action or docker file, if it is a docker action.  

These files with any other dependencies that they might have are the files that make up ana ction and therefore these are the files that must be stored in the GitHub repository.    

The workflow might be in the same repository as the action itself, or it may be in a different one.    
If the workflow and an action are present in the same repository, then the action becomes Private.    
If the workflow and an action are present in the different repository, then the action becomes Public.     

We can see similar distinction made on the action settings of GitHub repository that contains workflow.  

Third party actions are nothing but public actions and the local actions are nothing but the private actions (actions on the same repository or from same organization).

*Public and Private actions are referenced differently from the workflow*  

To refer the public actions  

```yaml
- name: Public action
  uses: owner/repo@ref # normally we reference a specific version of the action, but we can also reference a specific commit of the action too by using commit SHA. We can also reference a branch name if available.
  # For docker images, we can directly specify the container of the image
  uses: docker://image:tag
```

To refer the private actions which exist in the same directory as the workflow directory.  

```yaml
- name: Private action
  uses: ./path/to/action #location of private action relative to the repository routes. This could be any directory but
  # custom actions should be in the dedicated directory that is under .github/actions
```
