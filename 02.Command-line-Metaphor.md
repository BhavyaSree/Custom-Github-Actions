todo: The Command-line Metaphor
---

A useful way to conceptualize actions is to think them as command line programs.  

### Commandline

To invoke a program, we type program name to invoke it in command line

In command line
```shell
$ program
```

In actions
```yaml
- name: Run action
  uses: action@v1 # to invoke a program
```

If we want to pass an argument to command line program

In command line
```shell
$ program -param=arg
```

In actions
```yaml
- name: Run action
  uses: action@v1 # to invoke a program
  with:
    param: arg
```

To extract the return values by the programs

In command line
```shell
$ output = $(program)
$ echo $output
```

In actions
```yaml
${{ steps.id.outputs.name }}
```

Exit codes

In command line
```
$ echo $?
```
This returns 0 if job has been run successfully otherwise 1

In actions also, 0 indicates success and anything else if there is an error.  

Therefore, Github actions behave alot like command line programs.  

Actions run their own process, isolated from each other and from the workflow itself, just like programs are isolated from each other and from the council.
